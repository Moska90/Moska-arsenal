This is my very first mod, I'll be adding random things that I want/like so that I'm able to learn about minecraft modding.

### Custom items

1. Voidreaper (Mace)

	This weapon straight from hell adds +5 Hearts when on inventory
	
	![[crimson_reaper.png]]
2. Crimsonite (Ingot)

	![[crimsonite.png]]
3. Voidreaper (Mace v2)

	This void infused weapons adds +10 Hearts when on inventory
	
	![[void_reaper.png]]
4. Void Smithing Template

	![[void_upgrade.png]]

### Possible ideas
1. Make the Voidreaper give a second row of hearts when on inventory.
2. Make a katana or similar weapon that gives permanent speed or strength
3. Make a trident (maybe gives dolphin grace?)
